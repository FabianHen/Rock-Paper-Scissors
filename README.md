# Rock Paper Scissors Game - README
This is a Unity project for a game based on the classic game "Rock Paper Scissors." In this game, you can place objects representing Rock, Paper, and Scissors on a game area. The basic rules of Rock Paper Scissors determine which object can defeat another, and you have the option to choose between destruction and transformation for the losing object.

## Project Description
The project is developed using Unity version 2021.3.16f1. **It is important to note that this game is not a perfect implementation but rather a learning experience in utilizing Unity's features. This project serves as a stepping stone towards future projects where I can further refine my skills and create more complex games.**

## Installation
 To run this game on your machine, please follow these simple steps:

	1. Download the game files from the released version.

	2. Extract the downloaded files to a desired location on your computer.

	3. Navigate to the extracted folder and locate the executable file (.exe) for the game.

	4. Double-click the executable file to launch the game.

## Gameplay Instructions
- Upon launching the game, you will be presented with the main menu interface.

- Here you can select between exiting the game, looking into the option(s) and starting to play.

- You can interact with the game area by selecting and placing the objects (Rock, Paper, and Scissors).

- Each object is represented by its own icon.

- You can change the games speed by using the icons above the play area.

- When two objects collide on the game area, the game determines which object defeats the other based on the rules of Rock Paper Scissors. For example, Rock defeats Scissors, Scissors defeats Paper, and Paper defeats Rock.

- The losing object will be destroyed or transformed, and the winning object will remain on the game area.

- The game will pause when only one type of object is left.
